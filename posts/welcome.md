# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first post on my new blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## Getting Started

This blog is built with Next.js and uses markdown files for content. Each post is a simple markdown file in the `posts` folder.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in markdown
- **Modern Design**: Built with the OKLCH color system
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark mode support
- **Fast**: Powered by Next.js

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing more posts about development, design, and other topics that interest me. Stay tuned!
